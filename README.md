# Get Spaced

This is a hangman variant built using Javascript.

How to play?

1. Click on the airlock center box shown in black
2. Begin typing letters to guess the 4 letter word
3. Every wrong answer lights up the airlock release dial (shown by the red dots)
4. You get 10 wrong answers before you "Get Spaced"!
5. The dots turn from blue to red upon incorrect guesses.

Goodluck! (p.s. sometimes its fun just to get spaced to see what happens)
